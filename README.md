# PlanetSimulation

A simple physics engine that shows the interaction of gravity between objects.

## How to use 

- w — Zoom in
- s — Zoom out
- d — Increase physics time intervals. If this gets too large, the program will become extremely inaccurate, and things will go whack.
- s — Decrease physics time intervals. This causes the objects to move slower and increases the accuracy of the simulation.
